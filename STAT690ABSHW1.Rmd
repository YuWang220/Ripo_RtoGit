### (a)

```{r,out.width = "63%"}
data(studentdata)
Dvds <- studentdata$Dvds
hist(Dvds)
```

### (b)

```{r}
summary(Dvds)
```

### (c)

```{r ,out.width = "70%"}
#table(Dvds)
barplot(table(Dvds))
```

We could see that when the numbers of Dvds is equal to 10,15,20,etc, It would have higher values. Therefore may be 5 dvds was regards as a set and student will be willing to have a set instead of buying one by one.
